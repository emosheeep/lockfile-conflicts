Helps to merge certain files and execute commands after merge/rebase.

## Quick start

First of all, install the dependencies in your project.

```shell
pnpm install lockfile-conflicts -D
```

Edit `package.json` > prepare script and run it once:

```shell
npm pkg set scripts.prepare="lockfile install"
npm run prepare
```

And then commit the changes made by the command. After installed, a custom merge driver will be defined and applied to merge certain files.

## Uses with other tool

In order to execute custom scripts automatically at proper time, we need to inject some shell script to git hooks, **which may cause conflicts with other git hook tools**, e.g. _husky, simple-git-hooks_ and so on.

In this case, you can place install script of lockfile-conflicts right after theirs. For an example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install && lockfile install",
    "prepare": "simple-git-hooks && lockfile install",
    "prepare": "<other git hooks tool> && lockfile install"
  }
}
```

## How does it install

When it was installed. it has done these things:

1. Initialize config directory (default is .lockfile), see [Introduction](./config/README.md).
2. Add git config to local repository, you can view them through `git config -l --local`.
3. Add shell scripts to some git hooks, which helps to execute custom script at proper time.

Don't worry, all of these can be removed easily by execute `npx lockfile uninstall [--force]`

# About merge driver

> This section is revised from [Example of how to configure a custom git merge driver](https://github.com/Praqma/git-merge-driver)

A merge driver defines how git merge a certain file, it usually uses with `.gitattributes`. For more, visit [Docs - Git Attributes](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes).

## Define the driver

This is done in the `.git/config` file using `git config` command:
```shell
git config merge.[driver-name].name xxx
git config merge.[driver-name].driver xxx
```

```properties
[merge "lockfile-conflicts"]
  name = A custom merge driver used to resolve conflicts in certain files
  driver = lockfile merge %O %A %B %P
```

The `merge` block contains the merge driver's **identifier**, it
's `lockfile-conflicts` here, used to reference the merge driver later.

The `name` property contains a description of the merge driver, this project doesn't use this property because it's not necessary.

The `driver` property contains the command that will be called when a conflict occurs. There's a handful of predefined parameters, most notably:

- `%O`: ancestorâ€™s version of the conflicting file
- `%A`: ours version of the conflicting file
- `%B`: theirs branch's version of the conflicting file
- `%P`: the conflicting file relative path

_Note: Any tools or scripts called by the merge driver must be available on `$PATH`_.

## Use driver to merge file

Add patterns you want the merge driver to be used for in the `.gitattributes` file:

```properties
# .gitattributes
*pnpm-lock.yaml merge=my-custom-driver
```

## Distribution

Note that, much like git hooks, the `.git/config` file can't be checked in/shared through the repository.

A common way of distributing merge drivers is to check the configuration file in elsewhere and provide a script to copy it to `.git/config`.

In this project, the step above is included by `lockfile install` command.
